We produced a tool to generate time-series using the two methods Hidden Markov Models and Singular Spectrum Analysis. For this, we studied the necessary theory behind the approaches and then implemented them in Python. In the case of Hidden Markov Models, we also created a distributed implementation using Apache Spark. 

Hidden Markov Models are a good tool for the generation of data, although they can not model longer-term relationships or seasonality. Singular Spectrum Analysis is a powerful tool for time-series analysis and has some generation capabilities utilizing forecasting. 

Finally, we applied the generated time-series to benchmarking Apache Flink. We submitted jobs scheduled according to a time-series and observed Flink responding to the workload appropriately.
