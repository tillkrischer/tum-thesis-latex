%TODO: Abstract


This paper deals with generation of time-series using the two approaches Hidden Markov Models and Singular Spectrum Analysis. It looks at both the theory behind as well as the practical implementation of these approaches. The paper will also present a time series generation tool in Python based on these two approaches. In the Hidden Markov Model case the implementation will also include a distributed variant using Apache Spark. Finally the paper explores an benchmarking of an Apache Flink cluster as an application of generated time series.
