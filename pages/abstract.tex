%TODO: Abstract


This thesis deals with the generation of time-series using the two approaches Hidden Markov Models and Singular Spectrum Analysis. It looks at both the theory behind as well as the practical implementation of these approaches. The paper will also present a time-series generation tool in Python based on these two approaches. In the Hidden Markov Model case, the implementation will also include a distributed variant using Apache Spark. Finally, the paper explores the benchmarking of an Apache Flink cluster as an application for generated time-series data.
